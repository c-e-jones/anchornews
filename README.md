# Birmingham Anchor: A Local News Site Focused on the Birmingham Area
## A capstone project by Carl Jones

##  Project Description

### Base Concept

The base concept of this project was a simple full-stack development project, for which I designed the scope to be a simple news website focused on the local Birmingham area.

The name selected for this project was decided as the Birmingham Anchor. 


### Key Features

1. To provide a user authentication system, which allows users to log into the website and add records to the site.
2. CRUD functionality, which allows users to create, read, update and delete records added to the site. In the context of this website, it was simply a comment field, that allows users to discuss the news below the article in question, as well as edit or delete those comments / modify their review of the article.
3. Clearly understood structure, with clear content. This was achieved in this website by ensuring that content is neatly organised, in reverse chronological order, with tags for what genre of news the article fits into. This should provide an easily understood and navigable site design.
4. Responsivity - this site is designed with a mobile-first orientation, optimised primarily around being usable fully on any handheld device.


##  UX

The UX is intended to be as simple as feasibly possible, presenting the user with a simple news site design. 

### Users

The target audience of the site is users within the Birmingham area, seeking news and views about local issues and events. Due to this, most of the content on the website is tagged with locality in mind, with features looking to local government news, local events, wider regional events in the West Midlands area, and generally localised news. As most news sites can exist really without a national news section, there is also one of those. With this in mind, the target user for Birmingham Anchor is to provide an anchoring point to individuals in the West Midlands region who want local news and reporting, providing them a platform and ecosystem in which they can access and discuss news.

### Goals

The goal of this website is quite simplistic. It is to provide an easily read and understood centralized location for local reporting and discussion to be held about local events in the West Midlands region, but primarily Birmingham. Future feature concepts are the ability to actually sort articles by their genre category, to provide an average review score, and to enable users of the website to provide their own news articles to the site, transforming it from a news outlet into a news forum-blog structure. 


## AGILE Methodology

The development of this project used Agile tools in it's development, seeking to streamline the development process. Some of the key elements of this were **a kanban board and wireframing tools.**

### Kanban Board

To manage the workload of the task, I used the built in projects tools that GitHub provides, under the kanban tile view. For this, I added tasks as necessary, and moved them into appropriate categories as needed.

### Wireframing

To conduct my basic wireframing, I used Balsamiq. Due to the simplicity of the website design, I only produced high quality wireframes.
